						Gabriel García Márquez was born in March 6, 1927 in Aracataca, Colombia,.
						To start his formal education, he was sent to an internship in Barranquilla. There, he gained a reputation of being a timid boy who wrote humorous poems and drew humorous comic strips. 
						In the Colegio jesuita San José where he published his first poems in the school magazine Juventud.

						After his graduation in 1947, García Márquez stayed in Bogotá to study law at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, but spent most of his spare time reading fiction. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka, particularly in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges, was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited by the idea of writing, not traditional literature, but in a style similar to his grandfather's stories. His desire to be a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the 13 September 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.

						<img src="./authors/gabriel/book3.jpg" class="bookcover" alt="cover of Living to Tell the Tale" title="Living to Tell the Tale" width="265" height="400"/>
	
						<p> 
							Living to Tell the Tale spans Marquez's life from his birth in 1927 through the beginning of his career as a writer to the moment in the 1950s when he proposed to the woman who would become his wife. It is a tale of people, places and events as they occur to him: family, work, politics, books and music, his beloved Columbia, parts of his history until now undisclosed and incidents that would later appear, transmuted and transposed in his fiction. A vivid, powerful, beguiling memoir that gives us the formation of Marquez as a writer and as a man.	</p>

						<img src="./authors/gabriel/book4.jpg" class="bookcover" alt="cover of The Autumn of the Patriarch" title="The Autumn of the Patriarch" width="265" height="400"/>
	
						<p> 
							From charity to deceit, benevolence to violence, fear of God to extreme cruelty, the dictator of The Autumn of the Patriarch embodies the best but also the worst of human nature. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the renowned master of magical realism, vividly portrays the dying tyrant caught in the prison of his own dictatorship. Employing an innovative, dreamlike style, and overflowing with symbolic descriptions, the novel transports the reader to a world that is at once fanciful and vividly real.</p>
