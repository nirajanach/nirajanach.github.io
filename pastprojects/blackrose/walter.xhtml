					<p>
						Walter Ellis Mosley was born in January 12, 1952 in California
						He was an only child and ascribes his writing imagination to "an emptiness in my childhood that I filled up with fantasies.<br/>
					
						He has written a series of best-selling historical mysteries featuring the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins, a black private investigator and World War II veteran living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California; they are perhaps his most popular works.
					
						He went through a "long-haired hippie" phase, drifting around Santa Cruz and Europe. Mosley dropped out of Goddard College, a liberal arts college in Plainfield, Vermont, and then earned a political science degree at Johnson State College. Abandoning a doctorate in political theory, he started work programming computers. He moved to New York in 1981 and met the dancer and choreographer Joy Kellman, whom he married in 1987. They separated 10 years later and were divorced in 2001. While working for Mobil Oil, Mosley took a writing course at City College in Harlem after being inspired by Alice Walker's book, The Color Purple.
					
					<br/> His direct inspirations include the detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Graham Greene and Raymond Chandler.

						<h3> The Futher Tales of Tempest Landry </h3>
	
						<img src="./authors/walter/book4.jpg" class="bookcover" alt="cover of The Futher Tales of Tempest Landry" title="The Futher Tales of Tempest Landry" width="265" height="400"/>
	
						<p> 
							When Tempest Landry was accidentally shot and killed by the police, St. Peter ruled that Tempest’s sins condemned him to hell. But Tempest refused to accept damnation, and even heaven can't overrule free will. Unless he goes willingly, the order of heaven and hell will collapse and Satan will reign over the chaos. The celestial authority sends an accounting angel to earth, to convince Tempest that he should sacrifice himself for the good of the world, and casts Tempest’s soul into the body of a man who has been convicted of serious crimes.
 
							While Tempest serves out another man's prison sentence, the angel Joshua is living among mankind. He has been stripped of his celestial powers, yet is still tasked with persuading Tempest to make the right choice. As the angel sees the many injustices his friend suffers, he begins to question the morality and rightness of his position.
